## Philosophy: Near-Native

This project follows a **near-native** approach. We prefer upstream, official solutions over custom implementations.

- If the application has an **official Helm chart**, use it as the base rather than writing one from scratch. The `helm/base/` directory may contain the upstream chart as a dependency or a thin wrapper around it.
- If the application has an **official Docker image**, use it. Only maintain a custom Dockerfile if the 7KGroup admins have determined the maintenance cost is justified (e.g., the official image is poorly maintained, insecure, or missing required features).
- The **platform chart** (`helm/platform/`) is always custom. This is where Hiroba adds value — wiring in databases, storage, secrets, observability, and other infrastructure that the upstream chart does not provide.

**Do not rewrite what upstream already does well.** The people who build the application know it best.

## Where to Add What

### Application changes (deployment, ports, probes, scaling)

Modify `helm/base/values.yaml` or, if using an upstream chart as a dependency, override values there. Do not duplicate upstream template logic — use the upstream chart's configuration surface.

### Database, storage, secrets, or observability

Add or modify resources under `helm/platform/templates/<category>/`. Each resource is gated by an `enabled` flag in `helm/platform/values.yaml`. Respect the subfolder organization:

| Category | Path | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| database | `templates/database/` | CNPG Cluster |
| storage | `templates/storage/` | S3 via Crossplane, S3 via Garage |
| secrets | `templates/secrets/` | ExternalSecret |
| observability | `templates/observability/` | ServiceMonitor, GrafanaDashboard, PrometheusRule |

### New platform provider variant

Platform resources support a `provider` switch. To add a new provider for an existing resource (e.g., a MinIO provider for S3):

1. Create `helm/platform/templates/storage/s3-minio.yaml`
2. Gate it with `{{- if and .Values.s3.enabled (eq .Values.s3.provider "minio") }}`
3. Add provider-specific values under `s3.minio:` in `values.yaml`

### Crossplane compositions this app provides

If this application exposes infrastructure that other apps can consume (e.g., a Keycloak deployment providing realm provisioning), add XRDs and Compositions under `crossplane/`. Place example Claims in `crossplane/examples/` so consumers know the API.

### GitOps orchestration

ArgoCD and FluxCD manifests live under `gitops/`. There are separate manifests for base and platform charts because they have different lifecycles — the base chart deploys frequently, platform resources change rarely.

```text
gitops/
├── values-base.yaml              # Baseline Helm overrides for helm/base
├── values-platform.yaml          # Baseline Helm overrides for helm/platform
├── argocd/
│   ├── project.yaml              # AppProject scoping source repos and namespace
│   └── application.yaml          # <app>-base (auto-sync) + <app>-platform (manual)
└── fluxcd/
    ├── git-repository.yaml       # GitRepository source
    ├── helmrelease-base.yaml     # HelmRelease for helm/base
    └── helmrelease-platform.yaml # HelmRelease for helm/platform
```

Edit `values-base.yaml` and `values-platform.yaml` to set hostnames, resource limits, and feature flags. When deploying via a stack repo, copy these files into the stack's `apps/<app>/` directory.

### Documentation

All docs go under `docs/` and are published via Docusaurus. Keep docs in Markdown.
If updating the helm chart, be sure the corresponding README.md is also updated

### CI/CD workflows

There are two workflow files — `ci.yml` and `release-please.yml` — each calling a **single reusable workflow** from `7K-Hiroba/workflows-library` with a `stack` parameter to differentiate behavior. Do not inline CI/CD logic — add capabilities to the library workflow instead.

| Stack | `stack` param | CI trigger (path) | Release tag | release-please type |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| App (Dockerfile) | `app` | `Dockerfile`, `src/` | `app/v*` | `simple` |
| Helm Base | `helm` | `helm/base/` | `helm-base/v*` | `helm` (bumps Chart.yaml) |
| Helm Platform | `helm` | `helm/platform/` | `helm-platform/v*` | `helm` (bumps Chart.yaml) |
| Docs | `docs` | `docs/` | `docs/v*` | `simple` |
| Crossplane | `crossplane` | `crossplane/` | `crossplane/v*` | `simple` |

**CI** (`ci.yml`) — jobs run conditionally based on which paths changed. The library workflow decides what to do based on `stack`: lint+template+unittest+test for `helm`, build+scan for `app`, validate for `crossplane`, etc.

**Releases** (`release-please.yml`) — fully automated via [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please). On every push to `main`, release-please reads conventional commits, determines which stacks need a release, and opens separate release PRs per component. When a release PR is merged, it creates the tag + GitHub Release and triggers the publish job for that stack.

**Commit messages drive versioning** — use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

- `fix(helm-base): correct probe path` → patch bump
- `feat(app): add health endpoint` → minor bump
- `feat(helm-platform)!: change CNPG API version` → major bump (breaking `!`)

The scope in the commit message should match the component path or name. Release-please uses path-based detection to assign commits to components.

**Configuration files:**

- `release-please-config.json` — component definitions, release types, changelog settings
- `.release-please-manifest.json` — tracks current version per component (committed by release-please)

## Technical Specifics

### API versions

- Prefer the **latest stable (GA) API version** for every resource. Avoid `v1alphaN` / `v1betaN` when a GA `v1` (or newer) exists upstream.
- When an upstream operator promotes an API to GA, update the template, the `_checks.yaml` capability probe, and any `helm unittest` fixtures together so they stay in sync.
- Only fall back to alpha/beta when upstream ships no GA version (e.g. `argoproj.io/v1alpha1` for Argo CD Application, `backstage.io/v1alpha1` for Backstage catalog entities).

### Helm

- API version: `apiVersion: v2`
- All resources use `app.kubernetes.io/*` standard labels via `_helpers.tpl`
- All resources include `app.kubernetes.io/part-of: hiroba` for traceability
- Security defaults: `runAsNonRoot: true`, `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true`, all capabilities dropped
- External traffic uses **Gateway API** (`gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1` HTTPRoute), not Ingress
- Every chart **must** include a `values.schema.json` — CI will fail without it. Helm lint and template rendering validate values against this schema automatically
- Every chart **must** include unit tests under `tests/` using [helm-unittest](https://github.com/helm-unittest/helm-unittest). Test files follow the naming convention `<template>_test.yaml`

### Values schema conventions

- Use [JSON Schema draft-07](https://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#)
- Set `additionalProperties: false` on key objects to catch typos
- Mark essential fields as `required` (e.g., `image`, `service`, `global.appName`)
- Use `enum` for fields with a fixed set of values (e.g., `pullPolicy`, `provider`)
- When adding a new value to `values.yaml`, always add the corresponding entry in `values.schema.json`

### Unit test conventions

- Tests live in `tests/` inside each chart directory
- One test file per template: `<template>_test.yaml`
- Each test file declares `suite`, `templates`, and a list of `tests`
- For platform chart tests, set `capabilities.apiVersions` to satisfy CRD checks in `_checks.yaml`
- Test both the default state (enabled/disabled) and customized values
- Test conditional rendering (e.g., resource created when enabled, absent when disabled)

### Platform chart conventions

- Every resource must be gated behind `<resource>.enabled` (default `false`)
- Resources with multiple backends must use a `<resource>.provider` switch
- Template files are named `<resource>-<provider>.yaml` inside the appropriate subfolder
- Use the `platform.name` and `platform.labels` helpers from `_helpers.tpl`

### Container images

- Prefer the official upstream image. Only build custom if justified.
- If custom: multi-stage build, non-root user (UID 1000), pinned base image versions, OCI labels
- Never use `:latest` tags

### Gateway API

- Use `gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1` HTTPRoute (not Ingress)
- Routes reference a parent Gateway via `parentRefs`
- Default is a catch-all PathPrefix `/` route to the Service

### External Secrets

- Use `external-secrets.io/v1` ExternalSecret
- Reference a `ClusterSecretStore` by default
- Map individual keys via `data[]` or bulk-import via `dataFrom[]`

### Observability

- ServiceMonitor for Prometheus scraping (requires prometheus-operator)
- Grafana dashboards deployed as ConfigMaps with `grafana_dashboard: "1"` label (sidecar discovery)
- PrometheusRules for alerting (error rate, latency)

## Dependency Management

[Renovate](https://docs.renovatebot.com/) is configured via `renovate.json5` to automatically open PRs when dependencies have new versions. It tracks:

- **Dockerfile base images** (e.g., `node:20-alpine`, `distroless` runtime)
- **GitHub Actions** versions in `.github/workflows/`
- **Container images in Helm values** (e.g., `imageName: ghcr.io/cloudnative-pg/postgresql:16.2` in platform chart)

Package rules group related updates into single PRs:

| Group | Includes | Commit prefix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `docker-base-images` | Dockerfile FROM image bumps | `fix(docker):` |
| `github-actions` | All GitHub Actions version bumps | `ci:` |
| (ungrouped) | Platform chart image updates | `fix(helm-platform):` |

When Renovate opens a PR for a Dockerfile base image update, verify the new image is compatible with your build and runtime requirements. Helm values image updates (e.g., PostgreSQL) should be tested on a cluster before merging.

## OpenCode Skills

Agent skills for this repository are maintained centrally in the [Hiroba](https://github.com/7K-Hiroba/Hiroba) repo under `.opencode/skills/`. Skills enforce standards when editing charts, Dockerfiles, GitOps manifests, and documentation.

To install them locally so they are available when working in this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/7K-Hiroba/Hiroba /tmp/hiroba
mkdir -p .opencode/skills
for skill in /tmp/hiroba/.opencode/skills/*/; do
  ln -sf "$skill" .opencode/skills/
done
```

Available skills and when they apply:

| Skill | Use when… |
| --- | --- |
| `helm-base` | Editing `helm/base/` templates, values, or schema |
| `helm-platform` | Editing `helm/platform/` templates, values, or schema |
| `cnpg-cluster` | Adding or modifying a CNPG `Cluster` resource |
| `crossplane-s3` | Adding or modifying S3 storage resources |
| `garage-s3` | Working with the Garage S3 provider specifically |
| `external-secrets` | Adding or modifying `ExternalSecret` resources |
| `observability` | Adding or modifying ServiceMonitor, PrometheusRules, or Grafana dashboards |
| `gitops` | Editing ArgoCD or FluxCD manifests under `gitops/` |
| `helm-chart-release` | Preparing a chart release, writing commit messages, versioning |
| `dockerfile` | Creating or modifying a `Dockerfile` |
| `documentation` | Creating or editing Markdown files under `docs/` |

If this repo requires standards not covered by the Hiroba baseline, add a skill directly in `.opencode/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` alongside the symlinks and open a PR to Hiroba to include it upstream.

## Markdown Linting

CI runs [markdownlint-cli2](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint-cli2) on every pull request. Any violation fails the build.

**After creating or editing any `.md` file, you must run the linter before committing:**

```bash
npx markdownlint-cli2 "**/*.md"
```

- Rules are configured in `.markdownlint.yaml` at the repository root.
- Fix every reported error. Do not disable rules inline or in config to silence warnings — fix the underlying markup instead.
- Common issues: fenced code blocks without a language tag (MD040), table separator rows missing spaces around pipes (MD060), missing blank lines before/after lists and headings (MD032, MD022), and duplicate heading text across sections (MD024).
- If you add a new Markdown file, ensure it starts with a top-level `# Heading` (MD041).
- Run the linter again after making fixes to confirm zero errors before committing.
